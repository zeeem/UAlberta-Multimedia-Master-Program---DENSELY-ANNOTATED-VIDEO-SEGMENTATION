# Code for Generating BubbleNets Training Labels

## Overview
generate_labels is provided to enable users to quickly develop their own training labels for BubbleNets.
Previously generated labels for the entire DAVIS 2016 dataset are provided in ``./labels/DAVIS16_labels.pk``.

Please cite our paper if you find it useful for your research.

### Demo
Just run ``./gen_seg_performance_labels.py`` with TensorFlow sourced.
This will generate new, frame-specific performance labels (like those used to train BubbleNets in our paper).
New labels are saved in the ``./labels`` folder.

__Generating Training Labels:__ We generate a training label y for each frame, which represents the segmentation performance associated with selecting that frame for annotation.

<br />

### Setup
Add new data to ``./source_data/`` folder following the examples already provided.
Each video folder in source_data will be used to generate new frame-specific performance labels for training BubbleNets.
Generated labels are saved in ``./labels/``.

Each unique video folder contains source images in the ``src`` folder and ground truth annotation masks in the ``ground_truth`` folder.
The mask should have the same name as its corresponding source image (e.g., 00054.png).

The image-trained process (currently OSVOS segmentation) and evaluation (currently mean Jaccard measure and contour accuracy) can both be changed in lines 59-63 in ``./gen_seg_performance_labels.py``.
Changing how labels are generated will, in effect, change the purpose of the frames that BubbleNets selects after training on those labels.

Currently, the segmentation network will train on each annotation for 500 iterations.
To change this, edit line 24 (``TRAIN_ITER = 500``) in  ``./gen_seg_performance_labels.py``.

### Execution Process
Run ``./gen_seg_performance_labels.py`` [native Python, requires TensorFlow].<br />
Newly generated labels are saved in ``./labels``.<br />
Model and segmentation files generated in ``./temp_results`` can be deleted to save disk space.
